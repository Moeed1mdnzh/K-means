# K-means algorithm

In this project we are visualizing one of the machine learning algorithms,the k means clustering algorithm.The point
of this project is to understand the way that k-means algorithm works.

# 7 Colors

At the first you run the file and the program wants you to enter the number of x and ys,they both should be the same.
After that,you have to enter the K parameter for segmentations.It shouldn't be larger than 7
because there were no more colors for segmenting in matplotlib so i was only able to add 7
colors for segmentations.
